In 1984, Crow proposed an image representation where each pixel value is replaced by the sum of all the pixels that belong to the rectangle defined by the lower left corner of the image and the pixel of our interest (Crow, 1984).  Even though more storage space is required to save the image, due to the larger numbers, the sum of every rectangle in the image can be calculated in constant time, once the table is constructed. The integral image can also be constructed in linear time O(n), where n is the number of pixels in the image. One iteration through the entire image is enough to replace the pixel values of the image. \newline
