	\par Above all, I would like to express my great gratitude to my industrial supervisors Dr. Michael Grant who had supported me continuously during my research and gave me the freedom to create a project of my own interest.
	
	\par Then, I would like to thanks Dr. Matthew Brown, who helped me during my first years of my studies by giving me valuable and informative feedback. He was always there to keep me working on the right track. 
	
	\par Equally important is my current supervisor Dr. Neil D.F. Campbell and he is not to be missed from the acknowledgements.
	
	\par Furthermore, special thanks are given to Dr. Mark Warren, Dr. Darren Cosker, MSc Susana Gonzalez Aracil and Dr. Ross Hill who occasionally advised me during my studies. 
	
	\par It further worth giving credits to my data providers, the Natural Environment Research Councilâ€™s Airborne Research Facility (NERC ARF) and Interpine Group Ltd. 
	
	\par Last but not least, I am extremely grateful to my funding organisations, the Centre for Digital Entertainement and Plymouth Marine Laboratory, who supported financially and consequently made this research possible.
