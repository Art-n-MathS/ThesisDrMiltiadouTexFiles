	\par Above all, I would like to express my great gratitude to my industrial supervisors Dr. Michael Grant who supported me both emotionally and professionally from the start till the end of my thesis. He also gave me the freedom to create a project of my own interest.
	
	\par Then, I would like to thanks Dr. Matthew Brown, who helped me during the first years of my studies by giving me valuable and informative feedback. He was always there to keep me working on the right track. 
	
	\par Equally important is the contribution of my current supervisor Dr. Neil D.F. Campbell, who helped me relax by making things sounds easy. He was always a positive present during the last one and half year of my thesis.
	
	\par Furthermore, special thanks are given to Dr. Mark Warren, Dr.  Daniel Clewley, Dr. Darren Cosker, MSc Susana Gonzalez Aracil, Dr. Ross Hill and MSc Diana Krusteva who occasionally advised me during my studies. 
	
	\par It further worth giving credits to my data providers, the Natural Environment Research Councilâ€™s Airborne Research Facility (NERC ARF) and Interpine Group Ltd. 
	
	\par Last but not least, I am extremely grateful to my funding organisations, the Centre for Digital Entertainement and Plymouth Marine Laboratory, who supported me financially and consequently made this research possible.
